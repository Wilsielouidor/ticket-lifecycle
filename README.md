<p> You can see the agent(Mateo)that has Supreme Admin (full access) to all tickets that have been submitted. Mateo has assigned tickets to the correct agent.  </p>

<h3>Working the Issue and Resolution </h3>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
After assigning tickets to the correct agent now the agents will keep communication with the customers on how their issue will be resolved. Once ticket is resolved the agent will finally send the message to the customer informing  why orhow the issue is resolved. Below you can see the communication between agents and the user.
